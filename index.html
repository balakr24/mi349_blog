          Lunchly is a lunch kit company cofounded by popular youtube creators Olajide "KSI" Olatunji, Logan Paul, and Jimmy "MrBeast" Donaldson. There are currently three products sold by Lunchly, a pizza kit, a turkey and cheese cracker kit, and a nachos and cheese kit. Each box includes a Prime, the energy drink company owned by Paul and Olatunji, and a Feastables, the chocolate bar company owned by Donaldson.

          The company has undergone much criticism since its release, mostly related to the product's marketing. Much of the product's marketing is centered around being a healthier alternative to the competetor lunch kit "Lunchable". Despite these claims, Lunchly is comprised of processed food and sugary drinks, and is not healthy for the product's target audience, young kids. Lunchly is also a blatant knock-off of Lunchable, selling the exact same food items and including a drink and chocolate bar in each box. Many have also questioned the morality of the business's founders. Though each creator has undergone their share of controversy for their own personal content, the release of Lunchly has sparked a new line of questioning. The marketing and promotional content released by the youtubers indicates that they are using their young impressionable audience for their own personal profit. They have not expressed any real concern in selling healthy foods to the children buying their product.

        <h2> Blog Post # 2 - KSI </h2>

            Olajide Olatunji, the popular youtuber known as KSI launched his music career in 2011 with his single "Lamborghini". Since then, he has released several albums featuring popular artists such as Rick Ross, Lil Pump, and Lil Wayne.

            KSI's latest release, "Thick of It" has been the target of mass criticism from the internet. The song has been critisized from every angle, mainly for its lyrics and music video. The line under the most fire is, "from the screen, to the ring, to the pen, to the king." The song's lyrics explain KSI's life and his journey as a youtuber, boxer, musician and finally as the self proclaimed "king" of all these categories. Many find these lyrics to be too literal and boastful and have taken to the internet to insult the lyric writing and rhyme scheme. The song's music video has also provoked jokes from the internet. One of the visuals is a Prime bottle, one of KSI's business ventures, frozen in a block of ice. KSI is known for the overpromotion of his drink company, and the inclusion of Prime in his video furthered this view of him. Many have also made fun of the video's poor graphics, specifically a shot of a singing ice sculpture. The sculpture is supposed to look like KSI, however it has an uncanny resembelance to streamer Kai Cenat as many have pointed out.
